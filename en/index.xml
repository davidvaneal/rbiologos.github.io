      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a biologist by profession and passionate about high mountain ecosystems. I consider myself a fairly curious, happy person, always with the desire to learn, know, explore different places full of nature and, above all, share my knowledge with colleagues (or those related to the profession) and with people who, due to different factors, are unaware fully the importance of the environment and the role of environmental education.</description>
